# ‚òÄÔ∏è Home Assistant Blueprints for GoodWe Photovoltaic Systems

This repository contains a set of Home Assistant blueprints designed to automate and optimize residential photovoltaic systems equipped with **GoodWe inverters**. These automations focus on smart battery management, solar forecast adaptation and energy optimization tailored to users with solar and battery installations in order to reduce energy costs. In its current state, the solution is most suitable for households that purchase electricity at a fixed rate and sell surplus power on the spot market.

## Prerequisites

### GoodWe Inverter
The main prerequisite for use this set of blueprints is solar system within Goodwe inverter, baterry system and Home Assistant **GoodWe Inverter** integration available at https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/goodwe/ which is native Home Assistant integration. Most of the blueprints assume **experimental** version of that integration available at https://github.com/mletenay/home-assistant-goodwe-inverter as a HACS component. Details are mentioned in each blueprint documentation.

### Input Season
The blueprints expect that the current season is set to know which scenarios are usable. To define this input select, you as a user can use code below and copy it to **configuration.yaml** file.

```YAML
input_select:
  season:
    name: Season
    options:
      - Summer
      - Spring/Autumn
      - Winter
    icon: mdi:calendar
```

## üîã Auto Set DoD

Automatically adjusts the Depth of Discharge (DoD) of the battery based on today's solar production forecast and your typical energy consumption. It ensures conservative discharge during low production periods (e.g., winter), while allowing deeper discharge during expected sunny days. Standard winter DoD value is set when SoC (state of charge) drops down to that value. The **basic GoodWe Inverter integration** is expected.
